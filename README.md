This project acts as an integral story element for the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fanfiction "Streetlight Pursuit." 
This website is featured in "Case 36B: S̴̭̝̐H̴̤͛E̵̲͝'̸͓̥́Ṡ̶͎̳̊ alone in the universe".

To the particularly clever and code-savvy readers--Winter, Mal, and Darkdoombob come to mind--hello! You are seen, and we're grateful that you care enough to come looking here. 
If you find anything, do consider telling the authors you found it before telling the readerbase. Some secrets are best kept between us. :)

If you want to run this project yourself, you need node, npm, and React. If it matters, I'm using node v22.5.1 and npm 10.8.2.

Leafgilly is the primary contributor to this project. You can reach out to me @leafgilly on Discord if you have any questions about development.
